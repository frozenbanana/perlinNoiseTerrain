# Perlin Noise Terrain
Simple implementation based on the code train on ![youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKB1hWWedMk)

Also possible to run on editor.p5js.org by pasting sketch.js into the editor and hit run.

# Purpose
To illustrate a better way to visualize a song and using wave forms.

# Result
![Audio Frequency Terrain](good-visualisation.png)

Width (x-axis) of the terrain can describe frequency
Height (y-axis) can describe amplitude
Depth (z-axis) can describe time

Note: Resulting terrain is based on perlin noise and not an audio file.
